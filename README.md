Pebble Super Fonts - Demo App
=============================

This demo app is based off the [app_font_browser] sample app and has been expanded to include many custom fonts and different text messages in each font.


Usage
-----

Initially you are presented with a menu of different font options.  The up and down buttons navigate the list.  Pressing back will exit the app and pressing the select button will show you a demo page.

On the demo page you can press select to cycle through the available text messages to see how they are presented in the font.  The up and down buttons switch to the previous and next fonts.  The back button returns you to the menu.

That's all there is to it.


How To Compile
--------------

Clone this repository on GitHub.  Then fire up [CloudPebble] and import this project from GitHub.  Open the source file `app_font_browser.c` and then press the green button to compile and send this to your phone.  Make sure you have the developer channel enabled on your phone and ideally it will get sent to your pebble within moments.


About the Fonts
---------------

These fonts have been hand selected for a variety of purposes.  Some are good digital watch faces, others are great for larger text and still more are good for smaller text.  The entire font family is included in the repository even if not all fonts are featured.  Use this app to get a good feel for the available fonts and then carefully study the entire family to make sure you get the font you need.
